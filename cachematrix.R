# Updated the cache matrix function
# This script creates two functions: makeCacheMatrix() and cacheSolve()
# These functions work together to cache the inverse of a matrix,
# so that it doesn't need to be recomputed every time.

## makeCacheMatrix()
# This function creates a special "matrix" object that can store its inverse.
# It returns a list containing functions to:
# 1. Set the value of the matrix
# 2. Get the value of the matrix
# 3. Set the inverse of the matrix
# 4. Get the inverse of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
}

## cacheSolve()
# This function computes the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix().
# If the inverse has already been calculated, it retrieves it from the cache.
# Otherwise, it calculates the inverse and stores it in the cache for future use.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
